This is a very tiny version of MicroEMACS that is little changed from
the version originally posted by Dave Conroy to USENET in 1986.  It
predates the very popular Daniel Lawrence version of MicroEMACS, which
is also much larger.

I have added a few features over the years, most recently etags and
cscope support, and ported it to numerous operating systems.
Currently this source tree supports only Unix and NT.  I seem to have
lost the source for the DOS and OS/2 versions, but they seem unlikely
to be useful in the future.

To build on Unix:

  mkdir obj
  cd obj
  ../configure
  make

To build on NT, you must have BCB 5 installed and have Borland make
in your path.  Then do the following:

  cd nt
  edit makefile and change the line that defines the BCB directory
  make
