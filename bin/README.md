# Prebuilt MicroEMACS executables

There are several prebuilt binary executable files in this directory,
for those situations where building is difficult or impossible.

There are two Windows executable: win32/pe.exe (native Win32)
and cygwin/pe.exe (Cygwin).  These are quite old (2007); I
haven't tried to build them since then.
