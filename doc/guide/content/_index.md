# What Is This?

This the web version of the [MicroEMACS manual](https://www.bloovis.com/cgit/microemacs/tree/doc/microemacs.pdf).
It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the web site, which you can find here.

This guide was written by the original author of MicroEMACS, David G. Conroy
of Digital Equipment Corporation.  I have updated it with information about
the features I've addded over the years.  Some of the information may seem
dated because it was written in the mid-1980s, when computers were far
less powerful than they are now, had very limited memory, and often used serial terminals instead
of built-in displays.
